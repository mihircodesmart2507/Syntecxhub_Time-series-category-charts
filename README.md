# Syntecxhub_Time-series-category-charts
Time series and category charts were created to analyze sales trends and compare key categories. Line charts show monthly and quarterly patterns, while bar and pie charts highlight sales by payment mode, sale type, and products. All charts were saved as PNGs, and a summary report was generated for insights.
